# Object-detection-and-counting-demo
sample combine Tensorflow detection function and counting function
## Environment
* cuda (choose version by you os and tensorflow version)
* cudnn (choose version by you os and tensorflow version)
* windows 10
## Python library
* tensorflow-gpu 1.14
* openCV
* labelImg
## File explain
* counting.py: It has tensorflow object detection class ,mqtt funciton and flask framework
* visualization_utils_count.py: count function
* model : faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28
## How to work
* After building eniveronment, personal model, and fix two python file
* commend : python counting.py
